1.INTRODUCTION

I examined the total runs scored from years 2011 to 2017, by the top 5 batsmen. I felt the need of normalization to exactly evaluate the player's performance thus I decided to evaluate the average runs of the players and found some interesting changes.

For instance, Rohit Sharma(Indian opener)  had a constant rise in his average, since 2012. Although his 'total runs scored' graph shows zig-zagged nature. 

Finally, normalization of data by correct factor is so crucial, here it was so simple to find in this example. However, there are lot more factors, which can help to evaluate a player, for example, Rohit Sharma played thrice as an opener till 2012, after that he opened the innings more than 80% and we can also see his success as an opener by his rising average, every year.
